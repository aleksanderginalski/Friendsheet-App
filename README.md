## �️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:
```
lib/
├── core/           # Core utilities, constants, errors
├── data/           # Data layer (models, repositories, datasources)
├── domain/         # Business logic layer (entities, use cases)
├── presentation/   # UI layer (screens, widgets, providers)
├── main.dart       # Application entry point
└── firebase_options.dart  # Firebase configuration
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter 3.0+ (Dart)
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture / MVVM
- **State Management:** Provider

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK:** 3.0 or higher
- **Dart:** 2.17 or higher
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code** with Flutter plugins
- **Android Emulator** or physical Android device
- **Git** for version control
- **Firebase Account** (free tier)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/aleksanderginalski/friendsheet-app.git
cd friendsheet
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```powershell
flutter pub get
```

3. **Firebase Setup**

You need to set up your own Firebase project:

a. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
b. Add an Android app with package name: `com.friendsheet.app`
c. Download `google-services.json` 
d. Place it in: `android/app/google-services.json`
e. Create `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase configuration

**Note:** `google-services.json` and `firebase_options.dart` are gitignored for security. You must create your own Firebase project.

4. **Run the app**
```powershell
flutter run
```

## 🎨 Code Style

This project follows Flutter's official style guide and uses `flutter_lints` for code quality.

**Key conventions:**
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Prefer single quotes for strings
- Use trailing commas for better formatting
- Keep files focused and under 300 lines
- Document public APIs with /// comments
